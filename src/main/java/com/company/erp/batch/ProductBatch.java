/**
 * A single stock receipt: N units of a product, at a branch, at a fixed
 * cost price, on a given date. This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for stock and
 * cost - Inventory is just a cached aggregate kept in sync with batches by
 * the same transaction that mutates them.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT have: sellingPrice, expiryDate, barcode. Different
 * batches of the same product may have different cost prices, and that
 * difference must be preserved through sales (FIFO COGS), transfers
 * (destination inherits source batch's cost), and returns (restock back
 * into the originating batch's cost) - never recalculated from the
 * product's current selling price.
