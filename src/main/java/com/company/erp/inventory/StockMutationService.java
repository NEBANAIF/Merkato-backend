/**
 * THE single entry point for every operation that changes stock. No other
 * service in the codebase should touch ProductBatch.remainingQuantity or
 * Inventory.quantity directly - Purchasing, POS/Sales, Transfers, Returns,
 * and manual adjustments all call one of the three methods below, and each
 * one is @Transactional so a failure partway through (e.g. the stock
 * history write fails) rolls back the batch and inventory changes too,
 * per spec section 33.
 *
 * Each operation also raises one Notification (except sales and sale voids, which
 * are reported as a sale) so the change shows up in the activity feed.
 *
 * This is also why StockHistory is guaranteed to be a complete ledger:
 * there is no code path that mutates stock without also calling
 * stockHistoryService.record(...) in the same method.
